I am currently on a co-op at Northrop Grumman using additive manufacturing technologies alongside mechanical design in NX to assist development of launch vehicles such as the OmegA and Antares rocket. I will be taking the following classes Fall 2020:

<blockquote>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.‚Äù -Carl Sagan</blockquote>
